The Task Manager project aims to provide a simple and intuitive interface for managing tasks. Users can add new tasks with titles and descriptions, mark them as completed or incomplete, edit task details including titles and descriptions, and delete tasks as needed. The application will also display a list of tasks along with their current status (completed or incomplete), allowing users to easily track their progress and manage their workload efficiently. With its straightforward functionality, Task Manager streamlines the task management process, making it convenient for individuals or teams to stay organized and productive.
